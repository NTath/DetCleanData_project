##Creating tidy data sets
###Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


The R script **run_analysis.R**  creates two *independant* series of *tidy* data sets after reading multiple txt data files. 
The original data files contain multiple measurements on different activities from different subjects. <br/><br/>
The R script after reading the data files:

<li>merges the data to create one data set
<li>extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
<li>labels the different variables
<li>creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject


The 'CodeBook.md' file contains information about the variables, the data, and any transformations or work is needed to clean up the data.
